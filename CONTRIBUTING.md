### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Process

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bin/setup
   ```
3. Run the tests to make sure everything is working:
   ```bash
   bundle exec rake
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```

2. **Write your code** following our coding standards (see below)

3. **Add or update tests** for your changes:
   ```bash
   bundle exec rspec spec/path/to/your_spec.rb
   ```

4. **Run the full test suite** to ensure nothing is broken:
   ```bash
   bundle exec rake spec
   ```

5. **Run the linter** to ensure code quality:
   ```bash
   bundle exec rubocop
   ```

6. **Generate documentation** to ensure it builds correctly:
   ```bash
   bundle exec yard doc
   ```

7. **Run all quality checks**:
   ```bash
   bundle exec rake quality
   ```

### Coding Standards

We follow standard Ruby conventions and use RuboCop to enforce code style:

- **Follow the Ruby Style Guide**
- **Use meaningful variable and method names**
- **Write clear, concise comments for complex logic**
- **Keep methods small and focused**
- **Write comprehensive tests for new functionality**

#### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Keep lines under 120 characters
- Use double quotes for strings
- Follow RuboCop rules (see `.rubocop.yml`)

#### Documentation

- Use YARD documentation format
- Document all public methods and classes
- Include usage examples where helpful
- Update README.md for user-facing changes

### Testing

We use RSpec for testing and aim for comprehensive test coverage:

- **Unit tests** for individual classes and methods
- **Integration tests** for API interactions (using VCR)
- **Test edge cases** and error conditions
- **Mock external dependencies** appropriately

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bundle exec rspec

# Run specific test file
bundle exec rspec spec/zotero/client_spec.rb

# Run tests with coverage
bundle exec rspec --format documentation

# Run quality checks (tests + linting + docs)
bundle exec rake quality
```

### Git Workflow

1. **Keep your fork up to date** with the upstream repository
2. **Create feature branches** from `main`
3. **Write clear commit messages** following conventional commit format:
   - `feat: add new API endpoint for collections`
   - `fix: resolve rate limiting issue`
   - `docs: update installation instructions`
   - `test: add specs for authentication`
4. **Keep commits focused** - one logical change per commit
5. **Rebase your branch** before submitting PR if needed

### Development Tasks

We track all development work in [TASKS.md](TASKS.md). If you're looking for something to work on:

1. Check the current phase we're working on
2. Look for unchecked items in that phase
3. Consider starting with smaller, well-defined tasks
4. Ask questions if anything is unclear

Current development phases:
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1: Foundation** - Complete
- üöß **Phase 2: Core API Client** - Next up
- üìã **Phase 3: Zotero API Features** - Coming soon

## Release Process

Releases are managed by maintainers following semantic versioning:

1. Update version in `lib/zotero/version.rb`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Create release PR
4. Tag release after merge
5. Publish to RubyGems
